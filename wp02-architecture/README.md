# WP02 - Cloud-Agnostic Authentication Architecture

## Context/Objective

You are working in a hybrid cloud environment consisting of a Microsoft Azure hub-spoke architecture and a private cloud. This environment provides services to more than 10,000 users, both over the internet and the company intranet. Due to IT policies, secure authentication is required for all access to the provided services.

## Task

Design a cloud-agnostic architecture for the GitHub Enterprise service authentication mechanisms that seamlessly works across both Azure cloud and the private cloud environment. Consider the following requirement and aspects.

This document outlines the cloud-agnostic authentication architecture that supports GitHub Enterprise across private cloud and Azure environments. It focuses on high availability, security, and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Primary IDP**: Keycloak serves as the main Identity Provider (IDP) with federation to Azure AD.
- **Backup IDP**: Backup mechanisms ensure availability through secondary Keycloak, Azure AD, or LDAP.
- **Protocols Supported**: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML.
- **Session Replication**: Sessions are replicated across regions for availability.
- **Offline Tokens**: Allow limited access during IDP downtime.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Using ELK Stack, Azure Monitor, and SIEM (Azure Sentinel) for real-time monitoring.

## Architecture Overview

- **High Availability**: Multi-region Keycloak deployment with load balancing.
- **Scalability**: Handles over 10,000 users, federating with multiple IdPs.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub integrated with OAuth and Personal Access Tokens (PAT).
- **Security**: Follows the Zero Trust Security Model, supporting MFA and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Reliability & Failover Mechanisms

- **Multi-Region Redundancy**: Geographically distributed Keycloak instances.
- **Load Balancers**: Ensure traffic is routed to active IDP instances.
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic scaling during traffic spikes.
- **Offline Tokens**: Maintain service continuity during outages.

## Security & Zero Trust Model

- **Identity Verification**: Continuous authentication using MFA and federated identities.
- **Least Privilege Access**: RBAC/ABAC ensures minimal access rights.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring using ELK Stack and SIEM.
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Limits access to only necessary resources.
- **Granular Access Control**: Context-aware security policies with real-time threat detection.

## OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flows

- **Authorization Code Flow**: For web and mobile applications.
- **Implicit Flow**: For single-page applications.
- **Client Credentials Flow**: For machine-to-machine communications.
- **Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow**: Direct client credential use (limited).

## Compliance & Security Standards

- Follows ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR compliance, ensuring encryption, access control, and regular audits.

## Monitoring & Alerting

- **Proactive Monitoring**: ELK Stack for tracking authentication and session events.
- **Auto-Healing**: Cloud-native self-healing capabilities for instance failure recovery.
